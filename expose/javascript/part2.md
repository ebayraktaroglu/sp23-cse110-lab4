1. Line 12 will print "3," the value of i when the loop ends.
2. Line 13 will print "150," the last discounted price calculated by the for loop.
3. Line 14 will print "150," which is the last final price calculated by the for loop.
4. The code will return a list of prices, prices that are the ones given to the function with the given discount applied to them. The list will be [50,100,150].
5. Line 12 will cause a ReferenceError, since i is only defined in the for loop, not outside it.
6. Line 13 will cause a ReferenceError, since discountedPrice is only defined in the for loop, not outside it.
7. Line 14 will print "150," which is the last final price calculated by the for loop. Even though the variable finalPrice is used in the for loop, it is defined outside it in the function, so finalPrice is defined in line 14.
8. The code will return a list of prices, prices that are the ones given to the function with the given discount applied to them. The list will be [50,100,150].
9. Line 11 gives a ReferenceError because i in only defined in the for loop, not outside it.
10. Line 12 will print "3," which is the length of the prices list when the function is called.
11. The code will return a list of prices, prices that are the ones given to the function with the given discount applied to them. The list will be [50,100,150].
